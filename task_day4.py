''' oke day 4 we learn about list and tuple, list is one of data type in python. list is mutable so we can 
modify tha data by using one of the methods which is have been provided by python like append,remove,etc.
we can see the implementation in the following code
'''
nama_students = ['anji', 'baim', 'dian', 'safa', 'sastro', 'anji', 'andre', 'M.fajar bimantoro', 'ari']

nama_students.append('thomas')

nama_students.remove('baim')

shortest = min(nama_students)

longgest = max(nama_students)

print(nama_students)

print(shortest)

print(longgest)
